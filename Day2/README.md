# Day 2 – File Permissions, Ownership & Users

### ✅ What I Did Today
- Learned Linux permission types: `r`, `w`, `x`
- Practiced changing permissions with `chmod`
- Changed file ownership using `chown` and groups with `chgrp`
- Created a new user and explored user permissions
- Understood security concepts behind file access

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Each file has owner, group, and others permissions.
- Numeric (e.g., 755) and symbolic (e.g., u+rwx,g+rx,o+r) permission notations are interchangeable.
- `root` user can override all permissions.
- Controlling permissions is essential for server security in DevOps.

**Next Goal → Day 3:** Learn about **process management** and **system monitoring** using `top`, `ps`, `kill`, and `systemctl`.
