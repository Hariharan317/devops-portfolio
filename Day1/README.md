# Day 1 – Linux Setup and Basic Commands

### ✅ What I Did Today
- Installed and set up Linux (Ubuntu / WSL / EC2)
- Practiced basic terminal commands: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`
- Created and organized directories and files
- Learned how to navigate and manage files using the command line

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Linux command-line navigation is the foundation of DevOps
- Using the terminal feels faster and more powerful than GUI
- Every DevOps engineer must be fluent in Linux file management
